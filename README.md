Dotfiles
========

Various personal config files adopted from countless sources and then
customized to various degrees.

Sources
-------

Some sources from which my dotfile derived.  This list is not complete and is
really more for my personal reference than for accreditation.

### vimrc ###

- [zenazn](https://github.com/zenazn/dotfiles), for some basic initial config
  and for plugin reference
- [trapd00r](https://github.com/trapd00r/configs/tree/master/vim), for Cabbrev
  and some other neat tricks
- Various sources at [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Engineering) for
  whitespace removal, using cstag, and other tricks (and for inventing XHP)
